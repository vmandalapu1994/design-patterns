The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern where a request is passed through 
a chain of handlers, with each handler having the ability to either handle the request or pass it to 
the next handler in the chain. This pattern allows for the decoupling of senders and receivers of a request, 
and it gives more than one object the chance to handle the request without explicitly specifying the receiver.

Sure! Let's say we have a system where we want to process requests for reimbursements. 
We can implement the Chain of Responsibility pattern to handle these requests.
